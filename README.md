# About-me
Hi, my name is Arwa.

I am a third-year student with an academic background in Cybersecurity. Throughout my studies, I have worked with topics such as system security, threat analysis, secure application development, and understanding how vulnerabilities are exploited and mitigated. This experience helped me build a strong analytical mindset and a deep interest in data-driven problem solving.

My background in Cybersecurity naturally led me to Machine Learning, where I am interested in how data and algorithms can be used to detect patterns, analyze behavior, and support intelligent security solutions.
